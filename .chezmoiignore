# My "Documents" only really exist in one place. Ignore the ones that don't exist:
{{ if not (stat (joinPath .chezmoi.homeDir "OneDrive - PoshCode")) }}
OneDrive - PoshCode
{{ else if not (stat (joinPath .chezmoi.homeDir "OneDrive - loanDepot")) }}
OneDrive - loanDepot
{{ else }}
# If either of the others exist, ignore Documents even though it DOES exist
